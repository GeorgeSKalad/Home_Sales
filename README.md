# PySpark Data Analysis Readme

This README file provides an overview of the PySpark code for performing data analysis on a dataset of home sales.


## Usage

1. Set the Spark version by modifying the `spark_version` variable in the code:
   ```python
   spark_version = 'spark-3.4.0'
   ```

2. Run the code in a Python environment that has the required dependencies installed.

3. The code performs various data analysis tasks on a dataset of home sales, including calculating average prices based on different criteria and working with cached tables.

4. The results of each analysis task are displayed in the console.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this code is available at the following URL:

- [Home Sales Dataset](https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.2/22-big-data/home_sales_revised.csv)

## Code Structure

- The code initializes a SparkSession and sets up the environment.

- It reads the home sales data from the AWS S3 bucket and creates a temporary view of the DataFrame.

- Several SQL queries are executed to answer specific questions about the dataset.

- The code also demonstrates caching of tables and compares the runtime of cached and uncached queries.

- Finally, it works with Parquet formatted data, creating a temporary table for analysis.

## Results

The code displays the results of each analysis task in the console, providing insights into the dataset.

## Performance

The code includes timing measurements to compare the runtime of cached and uncached queries, helping to understand the performance benefits of caching.
